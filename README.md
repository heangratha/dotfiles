# Kudos

1. These files are heavily inspired by https://peepcode.com/products/advanced-command-line.
If you're new to CLI, I highly recommend watching the screencast.
2. The tmux config file is a modified version of http://media.pragprog.com/titles/bhtmux/code/workflows/tmux.conf
tmux is awesome - This book helped me getting used to it and it's fun to read: http://pragprog.com/book/bhtmux/tmux
