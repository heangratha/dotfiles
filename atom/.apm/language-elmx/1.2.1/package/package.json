If these packages are not installed this functionality will be disabled.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. `apm install language-elmx`\n1. [Install `language-elm`](https://atom.io/packages/language-elm) - required for auto-completion.\n1. [Install `linter-elm-make`](https://atom.io/packages/linter-elm-make) - required for linting and in-place compilation.\n\n## Credits\n\nThe `elmx` grammar in this package is heavily inspired in the `jsx` grammar from the [react](https://atom.io/packages/react) package and the `html` grammar from the [language-html](https://atom.io/packages/language-html) package.\n\nLinting is provided thanks to [linter-elm-make](https://atom.io/packages/linter-elm-make), this package just pre-compiles the input `.elmx` into `.elm` and then updates the lint results.\n\nAuto-completion is provided thanks to [language-elm](https://atom.io/packages/language-elm), this package just proxies the call to adjust file names.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"language-elmx@1.2.1","_shasum":"98a9d81203b22af2e30e86c49976d3b3a27d1e8a","_resolved":"file:../d-116323-73225-i2nfb/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116323-73225-i2nfb/package.tgz"}
