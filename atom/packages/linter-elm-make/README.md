# linter-elm-make

Lint your Elm files in Atom with [linter](https://github.com/atom-community/linter) and `elm-make`.

## Installation

1. [Install `elm`](http://elm-lang.org/install).
1. `$ apm install linter`
1. `$ apm install language-elm`
1. `$ apm install linter-elm-make`
1. `$ which elm-make` and set that as your executable path in this installed package's configuration.

## Linting Modes

Linting is done on-the-fly by default. Make sure that the `Lint As You Type` option is checked in the `Linter` package settings.

To lint only upon saving the file, check the `Only Lint On Save` option of this package.

## Quick Fixes

Move your cursor to a problematic text range and choose `Linter Elm Make: Quick Fix` from the command palette to show the possible fixes. Select a fix from the list to apply it to your code.

Choosing `Linter Elm Make: Quick Fix All` will fix all the issues in the active text editor. If there is more than one fix for an issue, it will choose the first from the list.

You may also add something like this in your `keymap.cson`:

```
'atom-text-editor:not([mini])[data-grammar^="source elm"]':
  'f6': 'linter-elm-make:quick-fix'
  'shift-f6': 'linter-elm-make:quick-fix-all'

'.linter-elm-make atom-text-editor[mini]':
    'f6': 'core:confirm'
```
